<p>Understand the effect of increasing the sample size \(n\) on the sampling distribution of the sample average as estimator for the mean.</p>
<p>Consider \(n\) observations are drawn from the Bernoulli distribution,</p>
$$
\begin{align}
Y_i &\sim \text{Bernoulli}\left(p\right),
\end{align}
$$
<p>where \(p\) is a parameters representing the probability of success of the Bernoulli distribution.</p>
<p>We are interested in the sampling properties of the sample average \(\overline{Y}\) given by,</p>          
$$
\begin{align}
\overline{Y} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i},
\end{align}
$$          
<p>as estimator for the mean \(\mu=\text{E}\left(Y_{i}\right)\) of the Bernoulli distribution given by,</p>          
$$
\begin{align}
\mu=p,
\end{align}
$$
<p>where \(p\) is the probability of success of the Bernoulli distribution.</p>

<p>As the sample size \(n\) grows the sample average \(\overline{Y}\) gets closer to \(\mu\), i.e.,</p>

<span>Increasing the sample size increases the number of zeros and ones for one particular realization of the DGP.</span>

<!-- audio text figure 01 slider 02 -->
<span>Increasing the probability of success increases the number of ones for one particular realization of the DGP.</span>

<span>The figure shows:<br></span>
<span>The histogram of all estimated sample averages for all realizations of the DGP.<br></span>
<span>The red vertical dashed line represents the sample average for one particular realization of the DGP.</span>
<span>The green vertical dashed line represents the mean, i.e., the probability of success, of the underlying DGP.</span>

<!-- audio text figure 02 slider 01 -->
<span>By increasing the sample size the sample average concentrate more around the mean, i.e., the probability of success, used to generate the data.<br></span>
<span>This is the result of law of large numbers.</span>

<!-- audio text figure 02 slider 02 -->
<span>Changing the probability of success, i.e., changing the mean of the underlying DGP, shifts the histogram.</span>

<span>The figure shows:<br></span>
<span>The histogram of all standardized sample averages for all realizations of the DGP.<br></span>
<span>The red vertical dashed line represents the standardized sample average for one particular realization of the DGP.</span>
<span>The green vertical dashed curve represents the pdf of the standard normal distribution.</span>

<!-- audio text figure 03 slider 01 -->
<span>By increasing the sample size the sampling distribution of the standardized sample average gets closer to the standard normal distribution which pdf is illustrated by the green dashed curve.<br></span>
<span>This is the results of the central limit theorem.</span>

<!-- audio text figure 03 slider 02 -->
<span>Changing the probability of success does not effect the results of the central limit theorem.</span>
