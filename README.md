# interactive-illustration-tool

This repository contains a template to create an *interactive illustration tool*

## Motivation

<!-- general -->
A simple tool to satisfy students and instructurs needs:

* Students:
  * Intuition for abstract concepts using interactive illustration tool.
  * Combination of verbal or mathematical expression, interactions and anymations with and without audio explanations.
* Instructors:
  * Easy to implement and to deploy.
  * No specific software or software framework.

<!-- particular -->
An interactive illustration tool to provide intuation for otherwise abstract statistical concepts such as:

* [Module 1) Bernoulli distribution and sample average](https://raw.githack.com/mmoessler/illustration-statistical-concepts/main/ber-dis-sam-ave/ber_dis_sam_ave.html)
* [Module 2) Continuous uniform distribution and sample average](https://raw.githack.com/mmoessler/illustration-statistical-concepts/main/con-uni-dis-sam-ave/con_uni_dis_sam_ave.html)
* Simple linear regression model and OLS estimator
  * [Module 3) Sampling distribution and sample size](https://raw.githack.com/mmoessler/illustration-statistical-concepts/main/cs-lin-reg-ols-01/cs_lin_reg_ols_01.html)
  * [Module 4) Sample size and parameterization of the DGP](https://raw.githack.com/mmoessler/illustration-statistical-concepts/main/cs-lin-reg-ols-02/cs_lin_reg_ols_02.html)
  * [Module 5) Effect of Heteroskedasticitiy](https://raw.githack.com/mmoessler/illustration-statistical-concepts/main/cs-lin-reg-ols-03/cs_lin_reg_ols_03.html)
  * [Module 6) Effect of Omitted Variables](https://raw.githack.com/mmoessler/illustration-statistical-concepts/main/cs-lin-reg-ols-04/cs_lin_reg_ols_04.html)

The modules can be proved individually (see links above) or combined (see link below):
