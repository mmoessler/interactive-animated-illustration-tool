## DGPs and Estimators

### Univariate random variables and sample average

#### Module 1) Bernoulli distribution and sample average

This illustration shows the effect of changing (1) the sample size $n$ and (2) the probability of success $p$ of the Bernoulli distribution on the sampling distribution of the sample average as estimator for mean of the Bernoulli distribution.

#### Module 2) Continuous uniform distribution and sample average

This illustration shows the effect of changing (1) the sample size $n$, (2) the lower bound $a$ and (3) the upper bound $b$ of the continuous uniform distribution on the sampling distribution of the sample average as estimator for mean of the continuous uniform distribution.

### Simple linear regression model and OLS estimator

Illustration of the properties of the OLS estimator to estimate the slope coefficient $\beta_{1}$ of a linear regression model, i.e.,

$$
\begin{align}
Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{i} + u_{i}
\end{align}
$$

#### Module 3) Sampling distribution and sample size

This illustration shows the effect of (1) different realizations of the DGP $r$ and (2) changing the sample size $n$ on the sampling distribution of the OLS estimator for the slope coefficient of a simple linear regression model.

```

#### Module 4) Sample size and parameterization of the DGP

This illustration shows the effect of changing the parameters of the DGP, i.e., (1) changing the sample size $n$, (2) changing the slope coefficient $\beta_{1}$, (3) changing the variance of $u_{i}$, i.e., $\sigma_{u_{i}}^{2}$, and (4) changing the variance of $X_{i}$, i.e., $\sigma_{X}^{2}$, on the sampling distribution of the OLS estimator for the slope coefficient of a simple linear regression model.

#### Module 5) Effect of Heteroskedasticitiy

This illustration shows the effect of heteroskedasticity on the sampling distribution of the OLS estimator for the slope coefficient of a simple linear regression model.

#### Module 6) Effect of Omitted Variables

This illustration shows the effect of omitted variables on the sampling distribution of the OLS estimator for the slope coefficient of a simple linear regression model.
